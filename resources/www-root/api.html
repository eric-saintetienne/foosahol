    <h1>The foosaholics API</h1>

    There's only one resource of interest, at <a href="/results">/results</a>.  You can do:

    <ul>
      <li>GET: returns a list of results</li>
      <li>POST: Send in a result.  POST body should contain JSON similar to this: <pre>
          {"team1": { "colour": "red",  "score": 10, "attacker": "player1", "defender": "player2"},
           "team2": { "colour": "blue", "score": 4,  "attacker": "player3", "defender": "player4"}}
        </pre>
        There may also be a <tt>"meta"</tt> element in the root, which can contain anything.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>also</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>GET requests will accept a query param called "callback" for JSONP.</li>
      <li>JSONP clients can add a result by calling GET on that url with a header "X-HTTP-Method-Override: POST" and a query param called "body" which contains the same JSON that would go in the POST body.</li>
    </ul>
