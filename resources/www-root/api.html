    <h1>The foosaholics API</h1>

    There's only one resource of interest, at <a href="/results">/results</a>.  You can do:

    <ul>
      <li>GET: returns a list of results</li>
      <li>POST: Send in a result.  POST body should contain JSON similar to this: <pre>
{ "team1": { "colour": "red",  "score": 10, "attacker": "player1", "defender": "player2"},
  "team2": { "colour": "blue", "score": 4,  "attacker": "player3", "defender": "player4"}}
      </pre></li>
    </ul>

    Both GET and POST will accept a query param called "callback" for JSONP.
